    question: "What is WHY?",
    answer:
      "WHY is an upcoming, open-source social media platform owned by its users, not corporations. We’re building a space that brings back the friend-focused vibes of 2012 Facebook, with subreddit-style “tabs” for niche interests and a fair algorithm that lifts real talent. It’s all about authentic connections, true free speech, and putting users first.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why are we building WHY?",
    answer:
      "We’re tired of X’s censorship, Facebook’s ad overload, Reddit’s corporate sellout, TikTok’s privacy issues, and Instagram’s influencer noise. WHY is our answer—a platform that ditches the corporate baggage and gives power back to users with privacy, fairness, and real conversations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is WHY different from other social media platforms?",
    answer:
      "WHY isn’t beholden to shareholders or ad revenue. It’s user-owned and open-source, meaning transparency and community control. We prioritize friend feeds over forced trends, protect your privacy with GDPR, and champion free speech without bias—something most platforms can’t claim.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does “user-owned” mean for WHY?",
    answer:
      "No CEOs or boardrooms here. WHY is governed by its users, who shape its features, policies, and future. Think of it as a social media co-op where your voice actually matters, not just another corporate cash grab.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is WHY open-source?",
    answer:
      "Open-source means our code is public—anyone can check it, tweak it, or improve it. It keeps us honest, builds trust, and lets the community help craft a platform that truly serves its users, not hidden agendas.",
  },
  {
    question: "What features will WHY have?",
    answer:
      "Expect friend-focused feeds like early Facebook, “tabs” for niche communities (think subreddits), direct messaging, and multimedia sharing. No forced short-form content—just tools for real, unfiltered connections.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are “tabs” on WHY?",
    answer:
      "Tabs are community spaces for specific interests—like coding, music, or memes. Each has its own feed, moderators, and vibe, letting you dive deep into what you love without the clutter of a generic feed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will WHY push short-form content like TikTok or Instagram?",
    answer:
      "Nope. We’re not about addictive reels or fleeting stories. You can post what you want—short or long—but we won’t shove trends down your throat. It’s your space, your rules.",
  },
  {
    question: "How will WHY’s algorithm work?",
    answer:
      "Our algorithm will be open-source and user-friendly, prioritizing what you care about—friends and interests—while mixing in diverse perspectives. It’s built to lift quality content, not just what’s loud or viral.",
  },
  {
    question: "How will WHY support creators and talent?",
    answer:
      "We’ll spotlight real talent with a fair algorithm that values substance over hype. No pay-to-play or influencer overload—your work gets seen based on merit, not metrics.",
  },
  {
    question: "How will WHY handle free speech?",
    answer:
      "We’re all in on true free speech—left, right, or center. You can speak your mind without bias or silencing, as long as it’s legal and doesn’t harm others. No echo chambers, just open debate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will WHY censor content?",
    answer:
      "Only what’s illegal or dangerous—like violence or harassment. We’re not here to mute opinions we don’t like. Transparent guidelines and appeal tools will keep moderation fair.",
  },
  {
    question: "How will WHY tackle echo chambers?",
    answer:
      "Our feed won’t trap you in a bubble. It’ll blend your interests with new viewpoints, sparking real discussions instead of preaching to the choir. Diversity of thought is our strength.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about controversial topics on WHY?",
    answer:
      "Bring it on. We’ll provide tools for respectful debate, not shutdowns. Sensitive stuff stays up unless it crosses legal or safety lines—because real talk matters.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will WHY have community guidelines?",
    answer:
      "Yes, but they’ll be clear, community-driven, and focused on safety, not control. Expect rules against harm, not opinions, with input from users like you.",
  },
  {
    question: "How will WHY protect my privacy?",
    answer:
      "Privacy isn’t optional—it’s baked in. Based in Europe with GDPR compliance, we won’t track you without consent or sell your data. You’re in charge of what we know.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will WHY sell user data?",

  },
  {
    question: "How does WHY handle user data?",
    answer:
      "We collect only what’s needed to run the platform, and we’re upfront about it. You can see, download, or wipe your data anytime—no shady fine print.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is GDPR compliance a big deal for WHY?",
    answer:
      "It’s the gold standard for privacy. Being GDPR-compliant means we’re legally bound to protect your rights, unlike some platforms that dodge accountability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will WHY have ads?",
    answer:

  {
    question: "Why is WHY better than X?",
    answer:

  },

    answer:
